    This Java program, named LeapYear, is designed to determine if a given year is a leap year. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Swing, where users can input a year to check its leap year status. The main components include a text field for year input, a button to initiate the check, and a result display area that is not editable. 
    
    The logic to determine a leap year is implemented within the actionPerformed method, which checks if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400, following the standard rules for identifying leap years. An error message is displayed for invalid inputs. The program sets up the GUI layout, including positioning of the components, and makes the application window visible and non-resizable upon execution.
